# GFG_Hackathon - TheraVR
Project Objective:
The objective of this project was to develop an anxiety therapy VR environment, the Zen Garden, that could provide accessible and affordable therapy to individuals suffering from anxiety disorders in India. The project aimed to address the critical issue of mental health in areas where access to therapy is limited.

Methodology:
The project team began by conducting extensive research on anxiety disorders and the mental health industry in India. The team then worked with mental health experts to develop a therapy program that could be delivered through a VR environment. The Zen Garden VR app was developed using Google Cloud's Epyc instance, a high-performance computing platform that allows for a seamless VR experience. The app uses data analytics to understand user behavior and adapt therapy sessions accordingly.

Results:
The Zen Garden VR app provides a peaceful and calming environment that helps users to manage their anxiety. The app features a virtual therapist who asks questions and provides guidance to users. The therapy sessions can be personalized according to the user's needs, and longer sessions can be accessed through a premium subscription model. The app has the potential to impact millions of lives by providing accessible and affordable mental health services.

Future Development:
The project team plans to continue working with mental health experts to improve the quality of therapy sessions and expand the app's reach to other areas in India. The team also plans to explore the use of the metaverse to enhance the VR therapy experience.
